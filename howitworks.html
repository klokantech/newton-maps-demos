    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <p>The map itself consists of the data -- vector tiles (packed together into one .mbtiles file) + the style of the map (.json which defines colors, fonts, what to show and what not to show, etc.).</p>
    <p>We use TileServer-GL software to serve the final maps: as a true vector maps (vector tiles + style json) + raster fallback (on-the-fly rasterized .png tiles) for compatibility with existing software.</p>

    <p>The map can then be displayed with various library (javascript, mobile apps, ...) such as <em>Mapbox GL JS, OpenLayers (vector maps)</em> and <em>Leaflet, OpenLayers, ... (raster fallback)</em>.</p>
    <p>All these libraries provide extensive APIs for enhancing the map such as:
      <ul>
        <li>View manipulation (center, zoom, rotation, fitting bounds, ...)
        <li>Markers: customization, manipulation
        <li>Adding polygons and other features (often by loading remote GeoJSON files)
        <li>Event callbacks (when map changes position, user interactions, ...)
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Most of the demos will be showing features of Mapbox GL JS, sometimes with Leaflet fallback.</p>
